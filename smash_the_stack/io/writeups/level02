This challenge took far too long
First attempt to induce SIGFP
Only ways to do that are with divide-by-zero or floating point operations
The program also checks that second arg isn't falsey

Gave up and attempted alt
Challenge is to get exact floating point representation of the first few digits of pi
spent a long time trying to work within strtod's format to get an exact representation
Parsed value would jump from just below, to just above the target value.
Realized that this jump represented the granularity of float
Gave up trying to be tricky

Went back to original
Attempted to modify the values during a gdb session
Realized this wasn't possible because of setuid

Went back to Alt
Found page that talked about strtod's handling of Inf
Realized NaN was another corner case mentioned in the man page
Thought that it would probably not pass either the < or > comparators used to determine whether input should fail
Success

Solution:
```
/levels/level02_alt NaN
```
