Relatively simple RevEng
Open in gdb
Requires a single argument
Argument must be > 3 characters
Load in IDA
I'm thinking overflow
Memsetting all but last 4 chars to 0
    maybe nop sled through "bad" function -> "good" precedes "bad" so no dice
    maybe modify the 0x8048a4 address which is getting called -> bingo
Difference between the 0x58 and 0xc is 76
Test with 76 chars and dump memory -> a4 is next byte!
Want to replace with 0x74
    ASCII 't'
run with argument of any 76 ascii chars followed by a 't'

Solution:
```
/levels/level03 $(python -c "print 76*'a' + 't'") 
```
